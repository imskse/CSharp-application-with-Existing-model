Windows app with AI: connect C# application with tensorflow model


Many Data Scientists and Software Engineers use Python/R programming languages for their ML projects today. For example, in Python the final 
product of a data science workflow are serialized trained model files. These files needs to be deployed somehow to be used for real production
bushiness applications. So in this case the main question is: How can C# deserialize a typical Python ML model to be used in .NET business applications? 

Hear is a example how to using python trained model is C# application.
